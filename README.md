Students are expected to build their EI Quiz apps utilizing the following methods:

1. No HTML should exist in the `index.html` file that will not visibly persist throughout the entirety of the application.
2. All HTML should be generated using template generator functions.
3. The page should be re-rendered anytime whenever the STORE is updated by calling one singluar `render()` function.

You may use the application in this repository as an example, but please do not share its code with EI students.
